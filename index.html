        <h3>Born in San Jose. Raised in the Valley. I am a daughter, sister, and friend. Making empowering connections fuels my work and my mission to create. I’m a passionate person with various and diverse skills and interests. I love everything (literally) from music to movement, from marketing to technology, and from science to art. I support and involve myself with the community as much as I can because I love Fresno; it is home.

I work in different areas because in my early 20s I was lost but I am grateful for all the wandering I did because it eventually lead me to build and recognize a strong skill in marketing. I am an Independent Contractor with Realty Concepts training into a full-time position as a Realtor. I am learning how to build websites at Bitwise because it has always been an interest of mine to learn the skill… specifically the use of technology in media, art, and design. I am a cycling instructor at Cyclebar, so if you ever want to dance on a bike to bangers… I am your girl!</h3>
